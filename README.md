Employee Management System

by Lauren Rowe

## Description
This is a simple Node app that runs in the command-line.  It is designed to store and organize employee data using node, inquirer and MySQL.

## Installation & Usage

The repository can be cloned from my origin, and then dependencies must be installed using the 'npm install' command in the terminal. Once installed, the app can be run using the command 'node server.js'.

## Known Issues

For some reason, if I query for information in the mySQL database it seems to be able to retrieve the seeded information fine, but when I run the program and use the queries to call the same information, it comes up as undefined.  None of my functions will work if the table data is undefined.  You can see what I mean in the walkthrough video, and I talk about some of the things I tried.
